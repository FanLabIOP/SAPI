# SAPI
The name SAPI is an abbreviation of "Structure Analysis Programs with Intelligent control". It may also be read inversely as "Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica". SAPI is written in Fortran for crystallographic calculations and C++ for graphic operations. SAPI is based on MULTAN and differs from it mainly by the ability of resolving phase ambiguities due to pseudo symmetry.
